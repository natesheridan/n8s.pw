* Story Scroller Data Structure Documentation
*
* The `story` array is used by the StoryScroller component to generate a rich, animated narrative experience.
* Each object in the array represents a "scene" or "slide" in the story.
*
*
* ===== Object Properties =====
*
* text: (String)
*   - The main text to display for the scene.
*   - For simple, centered text scenes, this is all you need.
*   - Example: `text: "This is a simple story slide."`
*
* background: (String)
*   - URL for the background image of the scene.
*   - Can be a remote URL or a local path.
*
* component: (Object)
*   - Defines a dynamic component to be rendered in the scene (e.g., CarSvg, ServerRack, or a generic Image).
*   - `name`: (String) The name of the component to render. Must match a key in the `componentMap` in StoryScroller.jsx or be 'Image'.
*   - `props`: (Object) Props to pass to the component.
*     - `animationType`: (String, Optional) Defines the animation for the component.
*       - 'drive-by' (default for CarSvg/ServerRack): The component moves across the screen.
*       - 'slide-in-left': The component slides in from the left.
*       - 'slide-in-right': The component slides in from the right.
*       - 'zoom-in': The component scales up from the center.
*       - 'fade-in': The component simply fades in.
*     - `align`: (String, Optional) Used with side-by-side layouts. Determines which side the component is on. 'left' or 'right'.
*
* textBlock: (Object)
*   - An alternative to the simple `text` property, offering more control over text styling and positioning.
*   - `text`: (String) The text content.
*   - `align`: (String, Optional) Horizontal alignment for the text. 'left', 'right', or 'center'. Default is 'center'.
*   - `style`: (String, Optional) A predefined style for the text block.
*     - 'default': Standard paragraph text.
*     - 'quote': Larger, italicized text with a border, suitable for pull quotes.
*
* layout: (String, Optional)
*   - Defines the overall layout of the scene.
*   - 'center' (default): A simple, centered layout for text or a component.
*   - 'side-by-side': A split layout with a component on one side and text on the other.
*     - Requires `component` and `textBlock` to be defined with `align` properties.
*     - On mobile, this layout stacks vertically.
*
*
* ===== EXAMPLES =====
*
* 1. Simple Centered Text:
*   {
*     text: "Hello, world!",
*     background: 'url-to-image.jpg'
*   }
*
* 2. Component-only Scene (Drive-by animation):
*   {
*     text: "A car drives by.",
*     component: { name: 'CarSvg', props: { direction: 'left-to-right' } },
*     background: 'url-to-road.jpg'
*   }
*
* 3. Side-by-Side Layout (Image on left, Text on right):
*   {
*     layout: 'side-by-side',
*     textBlock: {
*       text: "Here is some descriptive text.",
*       align: 'right'
*     },
*     component: {
*       name: 'Image',
*       props: {
*         src: 'https://picsum.photos/400/600',
*         animationType: 'slide-in-left',
*         align: 'left'
*       }
*     },
*     background: 'url-to-bg.jpg'
*   }
*
* 4. Focused Quote Text Style:
*   {
*     layout: 'center',
*     textBlock: {
*       text: '"Creativity is intelligence having fun."',
*       style: 'quote'
*     },
*     background: 'url-to-abstract-bg.jpg'
*   }

I understand the nuances of the technology and know that while AI is a powerful ally, it's not a silver bullet. My deep understanding of core programming principles allows me to discern when a modern framework like React is the right choice, and when a lighter-weight option like Preactâ€”which this very site is built onâ€”is the more prudent path.
