                        Hey there! Thanks for wanting to reach out. Fair warning: my inbox is like a black hole 
                        where emails occasionally achieve quantum superposition ‚Äì they both exist and don't exist 
                        until I actually open them. <span className="emoji">üåå</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But don't let that stop you! I genuinely enjoy connecting with interesting people, 
                        and I promise I'll do my best to figure out quantum mechanics to respond.
